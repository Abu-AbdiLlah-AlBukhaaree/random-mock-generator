# RANDOM MOCK GENERATOR
 - Live Website: [Random Mock Generator](https://mock-exam-generator.netlify.app/)

This website was developed for a personal reason. 

I have a very important exam, and there is no online resource to practice past questions on the exam. I thought of a way of randomly testing my knowledge based on the past questions of the exam, so I developed this website to help generate random questions from random years.

I also added functionality to keep track of my score on completing each mock exam. Right now, the functionality has not been fully implemented, but I'll try to implement it before the exam.
